Owner-Approval Gate — Claude Code PreToolUse hook.

CLAUDE.md's core rule: "Never auto-execute send/pay/sign/ship." This is the code
enforcement of that rule for agent-run shell commands. It inspects each Bash
command BEFORE it runs and BLOCKS the ones that would push a customer-facing
message, move money, sign/ship, or deploy to production — unless the owner has
explicitly approved this session by setting  AIXMOS_OWNER_APPROVED=1  in the env.

Protocol: PreToolUse hooks receive a JSON blob on stdin. Exit 0 = allow; exit 2 =
block (stderr is shown back to the model). Fail-open on unexpected input so a
malformed payload never bricks the agent — this gate supports the owner rule, it
is not the sole control (approval primitives live in shared/owner-approval-gate/).

Tune the RISK patterns to your stack; keep this file installed (CLAUDE.md §NON-NEGOTIABLE).

INSTALL NOTE (2026-07-16): this is the home-directory copy. The TMMT repo registers
this hook as "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/owner-approval-gate.py". When a
session starts from ~ (the documented way to run Rick), CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR is ~,
so the gate resolves here. Keep both copies in sync.

FALSE-ALARM FIX (2026-09-23): the gate used to block on the mere TEXT of a risky
command appearing anywhere in the line — so writing a deny rule, a doc, or a memory
note that merely QUOTED "vercel --prod" was refused. Two scoping rules now apply
before the CLI patterns are tested:
  1. heredoc bodies are stripped (that is file CONTENT being written, not commands);
  2. CLI risks must sit in COMMAND POSITION — start of the line or right after a
     shell separator (; && || | newline $( `), optionally behind env assignments
     or a runner (npx/pnpm/yarn/bunx/sudo/env/time).
Network/SDK risks (an API host, or an SDK .create() call) still match anywhere,
because piping a curl at api.stripe.com is a real charge wherever it appears.
Runs on Bash and PowerShell tools (BRAINIAC uses PowerShell).
